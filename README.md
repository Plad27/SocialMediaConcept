# SocialMediaConcept

I decided to pivot my whole idea as my initial portfolio website would not require much of a backend and I wanted to challenge myself with something with a more complex backend. 
This website is a concept website for a social media platform, currently the idea is have a simple chatting interface and have users give feedback on it and register users who will help with the testing. 

I have set up a simple backend on postgres to store the data. the database is local hence a lot of the query commands and requests will not work.

I have implimented api call as well along with 3 simple routes and one dynamic route all in the app.js file.
